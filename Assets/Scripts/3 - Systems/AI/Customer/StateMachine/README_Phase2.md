# Customer AI State Machine - Phase 2 Implementation

## Overview
Phase 2 of the State Machine Pattern implementation has been completed. This phase focused on implementing individual state classes that convert the existing coroutine-based logic from `CustomerBehavior` into discrete, manageable state objects.

## Implemented State Classes

### 1. **EnteringState** (`States/EnteringState.cs`)
Handles customer entry into the shop and initial movement to shelves.

**Key Features:**
- **Store validation** - Checks if store is open before proceeding
- **Random shelf selection** - Finds and moves to an available shelf
- **Entry timeout** - Safety mechanism to prevent infinite entry loops
- **Movement validation** - Handles pathfinding failures gracefully

**Converted Logic:**
- Replaced `CustomerBehavior.HandleEnteringState()` coroutine
- Maintains original behavior: find shelf → move to shelf → transition to shopping
- Added enhanced error handling and timeout mechanisms

**Transition Rules:**
- ✅ `Entering → Shopping` (when shelf reached)
- ✅ `Entering → Leaving` (store closed, timeout, or no shelves available)
- ❌ `Entering → Purchasing` (blocked - must shop first)

### 2. **ShoppingState** (`States/ShoppingState.cs`)
Manages customer shopping behavior, shelf browsing, and product selection.

**Key Features:**
- **Shopping timer** - Tracks shopping duration against target time
- **Shelf browsing** - Random movement between shelves with cooldown
- **Product selection** - Periodic attempts to select products at current shelf
- **Store hours integration** - Adjusts behavior if store is closing soon
- **Hurry-up mechanism** - Reduces shopping time when store closing

**Converted Logic:**
- Replaced `CustomerBehavior.HandleShoppingState()` coroutine
- Maintains original timing and product selection logic
- Added shelf visit tracking and enhanced store hours integration

**Transition Rules:**
- ✅ `Shopping → Purchasing` (shopping time complete or has products)
- ✅ `Shopping → Leaving` (store closed)
- ❌ `Shopping → Entering` (blocked - no going backward)

### 3. **PurchasingState** (`States/PurchasingState.cs`)
Handles checkout process, queue management, and transaction completion.

**Key Features:**
- **Checkout finder** - Locates and scores available checkout counters
- **Queue integration** - Works with existing checkout queue system
- **Multi-phase processing** - Movement → Queue → Item placement → Transaction
- **Timeout handling** - Prevents infinite waiting in queues
- **Transaction tracking** - Monitors purchase completion

**Converted Logic:**
- Replaced `CustomerBehavior.HandlePurchasingState()` coroutine
- Maintains compatibility with existing checkout and queue systems
- Added enhanced queue management and timeout mechanisms

**Transition Rules:**
- ✅ `Purchasing → Leaving` (transaction complete or timeout)
- ❌ `Purchasing → Shopping/Entering` (blocked - checkout is final)

### 4. **LeavingState** (`States/LeavingState.cs`)
Manages customer exit process and cleanup.

**Key Features:**
- **Exit pathfinding** - Finds and moves to exit points
- **Fallback exit** - Alternative exit strategy if no exit points found
- **Customer cleanup** - Handles analytics, queue cleanup, and object destruction
- **Analytics integration** - Records visit metrics before leaving
- **Terminal state** - Prevents re-entry once leaving starts

**Converted Logic:**
- Replaced `CustomerBehavior.HandleLeavingState()` coroutine
- Added comprehensive cleanup and analytics tracking
- Enhanced exit pathfinding with fallback mechanisms

**Transition Rules:**
- ❌ **Terminal State** - No transitions allowed from Leaving

## Supporting Infrastructure

### 5. **CustomerStateFactory** (`CustomerStateFactory.cs`)
Factory class for creating and managing state instances.

**Key Features:**
- **Centralized creation** - Single point for state instantiation
- **State registration** - Helper methods for registering states with state machine
- **Type-safe creation** - Ensures correct state types are created

### 6. **CustomerStateMachineManager** (`CustomerStateMachineManager.cs`)
Concrete implementation of `ICustomerStateMachineManager` interface.

**Key Features:**
- **Lifecycle management** - Handles state machine initialization and cleanup
- **Component integration** - Manages relationships between customer components
- **Event handling** - Processes state machine events and errors
- **Debug support** - Comprehensive debugging and monitoring capabilities

## State Logic Conversion

### **From Coroutines to State Updates**

**Original Coroutine Pattern:**
```csharp
private IEnumerator HandleShoppingState()
{
    float shoppedTime = 0f;
    while (shoppedTime < shoppingTime)
    {
        // Shopping logic here
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(1f);
        shoppedTime += 1f;
    }
    ChangeState(CustomerState.Purchasing);
}
```

**New State-Based Pattern:**
```csharp
public override void OnUpdate(CustomerStateContext context)
{
    float shoppedTime = Time.time - shoppingStartTime;
    
    // Shopping logic here (same as coroutine)
    
    if (shoppedTime >= GetShoppingDuration(context))
    {
        context.RequestStateTransition(CustomerState.Purchasing, "Shopping complete");
    }
}
```

### **Key Improvements:**

1. **Better Error Handling** - Each state can handle errors independently
2. **Enhanced Debugging** - Rich debug information per state
3. **Flexible Timing** - No longer dependent on coroutine yields
4. **Event-Driven** - States communicate through context events
5. **Testable** - Each state can be unit tested independently

## Integration Points

### **With Existing Systems:**
- **CustomerMovement** - All movement operations preserved
- **Checkout System** - Queue management and transaction processing maintained
- **Store Hours** - Enhanced integration with store closing logic
- **Product Selection** - Existing `TrySelectProductsAtShelf` logic preserved

### **Context Data Sharing:**
- **Shopping Progress** - `ShelvesVisited`, `HasSelectedProducts`
- **Timing Information** - State duration tracking
- **Component Access** - Safe access to all customer components
- **Event Communication** - State transition requests and debug messages

## State Machine Architecture

### **State Lifecycle:**
1. **OnEnter()** - Initialize state-specific data, start behaviors
2. **OnUpdate()** - Process state logic, check transition conditions
3. **OnExit()** - Cleanup state data, record metrics

### **Transition Flow:**
```
Entering → Shopping → Purchasing → Leaving
    ↓         ↓           ↓
  Leaving   Leaving    Leaving (emergency exits)
```

### **Safety Mechanisms:**
- **Timeout Protection** - All states have maximum duration limits
- **Component Validation** - States validate required components before use
- **Emergency Exits** - Any state can transition to Leaving
- **Error Recovery** - Graceful handling of movement and pathfinding failures

## Phase 2 Achievements

### ✅ **Completed:**
1. **Four complete state implementations** with full functionality
2. **Coroutine logic conversion** maintaining existing behavior
3. **Enhanced error handling** and timeout mechanisms
4. **State factory and manager** for clean integration
5. **Comprehensive debugging** and monitoring capabilities
6. **Backward compatibility** with existing customer components

### ✅ **Maintained Functionality:**
- All original customer behaviors preserved
- Store hours integration enhanced
- Checkout and queue systems compatible
- Movement and pathfinding unchanged
- Product selection logic preserved

### ✅ **Added Improvements:**
- Better error recovery and timeout handling
- Enhanced debugging and state monitoring
- Flexible event-driven communication
- Testable, modular state design
- Comprehensive analytics integration

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

### **Integration with CustomerBehavior:**
1. Add state machine to `CustomerBehavior` component
2. Replace coroutine-based lifecycle with state machine updates
3. Provide backward compatibility during transition
4. Extensive testing with existing customer prefabs

### **Testing and Validation:**
1. Unit tests for individual states
2. Integration tests with existing systems
3. Performance comparison with coroutine-based system
4. Validation with complex customer scenarios
