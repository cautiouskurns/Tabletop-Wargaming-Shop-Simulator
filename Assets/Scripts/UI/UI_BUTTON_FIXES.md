# SOLUTION: Fix InventoryUI Button Issues

You've identified several critical issues. Here's how to fix them:

## üîß **Issues Identified:**
1. ‚úÖ Canvas exists but buttons have no images/icons
2. ‚úÖ Nothing happens when hovering/clicking buttons  
3. ‚úÖ Mouse cursor not visible (locked for first-person movement)
4. ‚úÖ Need to switch between crosshair and button cursor interaction

## üõ†Ô∏è **Complete Solution:**

### **Step 1: Fix Cursor Visibility**
I've created a `CursorManager` script. Add it to your scene:

1. **In Unity Hierarchy:**
   - The CursorManager GameObject was already created
   - Select it and add the `CursorManager` component
   - Set "Start With Cursor Locked" to `true`

2. **Controls:**
   - **Escape key**: Toggle cursor lock/unlock manually
   - **Tab key**: Auto-unlocks cursor when opening inventory
   - **Locked**: Mouse controls camera (crosshair mode)
   - **Unlocked**: Mouse can click UI buttons (cursor mode)

### **Step 2: Fix Button Icons**
Your buttons need product icons. I've created an `InventoryUISetupHelper`:

1. **Add the setup script:**
   - Select your InventoryCanvas
   - Add the `InventoryUISetupHelper` component
   
2. **Auto-setup everything:**
   - In the Inspector, click the context menu (‚ãÆ) 
   - Choose "Find and Assign References"
   - Then choose "Auto Setup Icons"
   - This will automatically assign the correct textures to each button

### **Step 3: Verify InventoryUI Configuration**
Make sure your InventoryCanvas has the InventoryUI script with:

- ‚úÖ **Inventory Canvas Group**: Assigned to InventoryPanel's CanvasGroup
- ‚úÖ **Product Buttons [3]**: 
  - Element 0: ProductButton (MiniatureBox)
  - Element 1: ProductButton (1) (PaintPot)
  - Element 2: ProductButton (2) (Rulebook)

### **Step 4: Test the Complete System**

1. **Start Play Mode**
2. **Press Tab** ‚Üí Inventory panel fades in, cursor becomes visible
3. **Click buttons** ‚Üí Should highlight and select products
4. **Press Tab again** ‚Üí Panel fades out, cursor locks for movement
5. **Press Escape** ‚Üí Toggle cursor lock manually anytime

## üéÆ **Expected Behavior:**

### **Movement Mode (Default):**
- Cursor: Locked and invisible (crosshair for aiming/movement)
- Tab: Opens inventory and switches to UI mode

### **UI Mode (Inventory Open):**
- Cursor: Visible and free to click buttons
- Buttons: Show icons, names, and counts
- Clicking: Selects product types (buttons highlight)
- Tab: Closes inventory and returns to movement mode

## üêõ **Troubleshooting:**

### **"Buttons still don't respond"**
- Check that Button components have "Interactable" checked
- Verify InventoryManager has ProductData assets assigned
- Make sure cursor is unlocked (press Escape to toggle)

### **"No icons showing"**
- Run the InventoryUISetupHelper auto-setup
- Check that texture files exist in Assets/Textures/
- Verify Image components exist as children of buttons

### **"Cursor stuck locked/unlocked"**
- Press Escape to manually toggle cursor state
- Check that CursorManager component is added to the GameObject

## üéØ **Quick Fix Summary:**
1. Add CursorManager component to the CursorManager GameObject
2. Add InventoryUISetupHelper to InventoryCanvas and run auto-setup
3. Test: Tab opens inventory + unlocks cursor, buttons should work
4. Use Escape to manually toggle cursor if needed

This creates a seamless experience: crosshair for movement, cursor for UI interaction!
