    entryTitle: The Runeforged Legion
    category: Characters
    description: 'Elite warriors who have bonded their souls to ancient runic weapons.
      Each Runeblade carries a sword, axe, or spear inscribed with mystical runes
      that grant supernatural abilities. The bonding process is dangerous - many
      who attempt it are consumed by the weapon''s power, but those who succeed become
      nearly unstoppable in battle.


      Led by Warmaster Thane Ironrune, the
      Legion serves as both protector and enforcer for the realm''s most sacred sites.'

    entryTitle: Runic Weapons
    category: Technology
    description: 'Ancient weapons forged in the First Age, each inscribed with runes
      of power. These weapons are not merely tools but living entities that choose
      their wielders. The runes glow with inner fire during combat, channeling elemental
      forces through the blade.


      Five types of runic weapons exist: Flamestrike
      (fire), Frostbite (ice), Stormcaller (lightning), Earthshaker (earth), and
      the legendary Voidrender (dark energy). Each requires different techniques
      and mental fortitude to master.'

    entryTitle: The Great Forging
    category: History
    description: 'Three thousand years ago, during the War of Shadows, the greatest
      smiths and mages united to create weapons capable of standing against the Void
      corruption. Working in the Forge of Eternal Flames, they inscribed the first
      runic weapons with protective wards and devastating power.


      The Great
      Forging lasted seven years and cost the lives of dozens of craftsmen, but the
      weapons they created turned the tide of war and established the Runeblade tradition
      that continues today.'

    category: Characters
    description: 'Once-mortal beings who have been transformed by prolonged exposure
      to Void energy. Their flesh takes on a darkened, crystalline appearance, and
      their eyes glow with purple fire. The Corrupted retain their intelligence and
      memories but gain terrible new abilities - phasing through solid matter, draining
      life force, and manipulating shadows.


      Despite their fearsome appearance,
      many Corrupted struggle with their humanity, caught between their former lives
      and their new dark nature.'

    entryTitle: Void Crystals
    category: Technology
    description: 'Crystalline formations that grow where the Void''s influence is
      strongest. These purple-black crystals pulse with malevolent energy and can
      power dark technologies or corrupt living beings who touch them. Void crystals
      are highly sought after by necromancers and forbidden researchers.


      The
      crystals seem to have a form of collective intelligence, growing in patterns
      that suggest purpose. Scholars theorize they may be fragments of a greater
      Void consciousness trying to manifest in our reality.'

    entryTitle: The Void Incursion
    category: History
    description: 'The catastrophic event that began the War of Shadows. Reality itself
      was torn open, allowing creatures and energy from the Void dimension to pour
      into our world. Entire cities were consumed in purple fire, and the survivors
      were forever changed.


      The Incursion lasted only three days, but its
      effects ripple through history. The tear in reality was sealed by the combined
      sacrifice of twelve archmages, but smaller rifts still appear randomly, bringing
      fresh waves of corruption and Voidborn creatures.'
