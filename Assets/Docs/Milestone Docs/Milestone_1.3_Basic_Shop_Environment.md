# Milestone 1.3: Basic Shop Environment - COMPLETED

## Overview
Successfully created a basic shop environment using Unity primitives with proper materials, physics colliders, and player positioning.

## Implementation Details

### Shop Structure
✅ **Floor**: 10x10 unit plane at Y=0 with brown wood-textured material
✅ **Walls**: 4 walls creating enclosed space (height 4 units, thickness 0.2 units)
✅ **Door Opening**: 2 units wide, 3 units tall opening in front wall
✅ **Materials**: Distinct brown floor material and cream/white wall material
✅ **Player Spawn**: Center of shop at (0, 0.1, 0)
✅ **Physics**: All objects have proper colliders for NavMesh and collision

### Scene Objects Created

#### Floor
- **Shop Floor**: 10x10 plane primitive at origin
- **Material**: Brown/tan FloorMaterial (RGB: 0.6, 0.4, 0.2)
- **Collider**: MeshCollider for NavMesh compatibility

#### Walls
- **Back Wall**: 10x4x0.2 cube at (0, 2, -5)
- **Left Wall**: 0.2x4x10 cube at (-5, 2, 0)
- **Right Wall**: 0.2x4x10 cube at (5, 2, 0)
- **Front Wall Left**: 4x4x0.2 cube at (-3, 2, 5)
- **Front Wall Right**: 4x4x0.2 cube at (3, 2, 5)
- **Door Header**: 2x1x0.2 cube at (0, 3.5, 5)
- **Material**: Cream/white WallMaterial (RGB: 0.95, 0.95, 0.9)
- **Colliders**: BoxColliders on all wall segments

#### Door Opening
- **Width**: 2 units (from X: -1 to X: +1)
- **Height**: 3 units (from Y: 0 to Y: +3)
- **Position**: Front wall center (Z: 5)
- **Clear passage** for customer entry/exit

### Materials Created
- **Assets/Materials/FloorMaterial.mat**: Brown wood-style floor
- **Assets/Materials/WallMaterial.mat**: Cream/white walls

### Player Setup
- **Position**: (0, 0.1, 0) - center of shop, slightly above floor
- **PlayerController**: Attached and configured
- **Movement**: Can walk around shop, cannot pass through walls
- **Camera**: First-person view at proper head height

## Test Results

### ✅ Physics Tests
- Player cannot walk through any walls ✓
- Door opening is clearly visible and navigable ✓
- Floor is flat and walkable ✓
- All colliders properly configured ✓

### ✅ Visual Tests
- Shop feels enclosed but not cramped ✓
- Materials distinguish floor from walls ✓
- Door opening clearly visible ✓
- Lighting adequate for navigation ✓

### ✅ NavMesh Compatibility
- Floor has MeshCollider suitable for NavMesh baking ✓
- Walls have BoxColliders that will create proper NavMesh boundaries ✓
- Door opening allows clear path for AI navigation ✓

## Technical Notes

### Dimensions
- **Shop Interior**: 10x10 units (50 square meters at 1 unit = 1 meter)
- **Wall Height**: 4 units (realistic room height)
- **Door Opening**: 2x3 units (standard door size)
- **Wall Thickness**: 0.2 units (prevents z-fighting, maintains collision)

### Positioning Logic
- **Floor**: Centered at origin for easy reference
- **Walls**: Positioned at boundaries (±5 units from center)
- **Door**: Centered on front wall for symmetrical layout
- **Player**: Slightly above floor to prevent clipping

## Next Steps Ready
1. **NavMesh Baking**: Environment ready for AI pathfinding
2. **Shelf Placement**: Clear wall space for product displays
3. **Lighting Enhancement**: Basic directional light in place
4. **Customer Spawning**: Door opening provides entry/exit point
