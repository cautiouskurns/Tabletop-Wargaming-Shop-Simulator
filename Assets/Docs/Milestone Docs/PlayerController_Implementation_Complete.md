# First-Person Player Controller - Implementation Complete

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

Your Unity 3D tabletop shop simulator now has a complete first-person player controller that meets all the specified requirements:

### 🎮 **Core Features Implemented**
- **WASD Movement**: Smooth directional movement using Unity's Input system
- **Mouse Look**: Full 360° horizontal and clamped vertical camera rotation
- **Configurable Speed**: Default 5 units/second (adjustable in Inspector)
- **Mouse Sensitivity**: Default 2.0 sensitivity (fully configurable)
- **Ground Detection**: Physics-based ground checking to prevent flying
- **Jump Functionality**: Space key jumping with realistic gravity
- **Camera Integration**: Properly positioned first-person camera

### 🏗️ **Scene Setup Complete**
- **ShopScene.unity**: Main game scene created and configured
- **Ground Plane**: 20x20 unit ground surface for testing
- **Player GameObject**: Capsule primitive with CharacterController
- **Player Camera**: Child camera positioned at head level (0.5 units up)
- **Directional Light**: Warm lighting setup for the scene

```

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

#### **PlayerController.cs Features:**
- **Namespace**: `TabletopShop` for proper code organization
- **Component Requirement**: Automatically requires CharacterController
- **Auto-Setup**: Creates camera and ground check if missing
- **Cursor Management**: Escape key toggles cursor lock/unlock
- **Physics Integration**: Manual gravity with CharacterController
- **Debug Visualization**: Gizmos show ground check status in Scene view

#### **Public API Methods:**
```csharp
SetMovementSpeed(float speed)      // Runtime speed adjustment
SetMouseSensitivity(float sens)    // Runtime sensitivity adjustment
IsGrounded()                       // Query ground state
GetVelocity()                      // Get current velocity vector
```

### 🎯 **Next Steps for MVP Development**

Based on your GDD, you're now ready to implement:

1. **Product System** (`Assets/ScriptableObjects/`)
   - Create ScriptableObjects for miniatures, paints, rulebooks
   - Define base prices and product properties

2. **Shop Environment** (`Assets/Prefabs/`)
   - Build shop interior with shelves
   - Create product display systems
   - Add shop entrance/exit

3. **Interaction System** (Extend PlayerController)
   - E key interaction detection
   - Shelf stocking mechanics
   - Price setting UI

4. **Customer AI** (`Assets/Scripts/`)
   - Basic NavMesh pathfinding
   - Purchase decision logic
   - Spawn/despawn system

5. **UI Systems** (`Assets/UI/`)
   - Money display HUD
   - Inventory management panel
   - Day management interface

### 🚀 **Ready to Test**

1. **Open ShopScene.unity** in Unity
2. **Add PlayerController script** to the Player GameObject
3. **Press Play** to test movement
4. **Use WASD + Mouse** to move and look around
5. **Press Space** to jump
6. **Press Escape** to unlock cursor

### 📋 **Controls Reference**
- **WASD**: Move forward/back/left/right
- **Mouse**: Look around (first-person camera)
- **Space**: Jump (only when grounded)
- **Escape**: Toggle cursor lock/unlock
