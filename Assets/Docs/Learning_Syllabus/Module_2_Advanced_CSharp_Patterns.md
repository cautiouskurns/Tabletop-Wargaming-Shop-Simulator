## üìö Lesson Breakdown

### Lesson 2.1: Interface Segregation in Unity üîå
**Difficulty**: üü° **Duration**: 60 minutes

#### Core Concepts
- **Interface Design Principles**: Small, focused interfaces vs monolithic ones
- **Unity-Specific Applications**: Component interfaces, system boundaries
- **Real Project Examples**: ICustomer, ICustomerBehavior, ICustomerMovement interfaces

#### Project Context
Our customer system evolved from a monolithic Customer class to a composition of specialized components, each implementing focused interfaces.

#### Key Learning Outcomes
- Design interfaces that follow single responsibility principle
- Understand how interface segregation improves testability and maintainability
- Implement Unity component interfaces that promote loose coupling

Customer entities consist of CustomerBehavior, CustomerMovement, CustomerVisuals, and CustomerEconomics components that work together seamlessly.

#### Key Learning Outcomes

### Lesson 2.3: Event-Driven Architecture üì°
**Difficulty**: üî¥ **Duration**: 90 minutes

#### Core Concepts
- **Event Systems**: C# events, Unity Events, and custom event patterns
- **Observer Pattern**: Implementing loose coupling through event observation
- **Performance Considerations**: Event system optimization and memory management

#### Project Context
Product purchase events, customer state changes, and UI updates are coordinated through event-driven patterns without direct coupling.

#### Key Learning Outcomes
- Design robust event systems for game architecture
- Implement the Observer pattern using C# events and UnityEvents
- Handle event subscription/unsubscription to prevent memory leaks

#### Files Referenced
- `Assets/Scripts/2 - Entities/Products/Interaction/ProductInteraction.cs` - Event publishing

### Lesson 2.4: ScriptableObject Data Management üìä
**Difficulty**: üü° **Duration**: 60 minutes

#### Core Concepts
- **Data-Driven Design**: Separating configuration from code logic
- **ScriptableObject Patterns**: Configuration objects, event channels, runtime sets
- **Asset Management**: Creating and managing ScriptableObject assets

#### Project Context
Product data, customer configuration, and game settings are managed through ScriptableObjects for flexibility and designer accessibility.

#### Key Learning Outcomes
- Create effective ScriptableObject architectures for game data
- Implement configuration systems that support runtime changes
- Use ScriptableObjects for communication between systems

#### Files Referenced
- `Assets/Scripts/0 - ScriptableObjects/ProductData.cs` - Product configuration data
- `Assets/Scripts/0 - ScriptableObjects/CustomerConfig.cs` - Customer behavior settings
- Various product data assets in `Assets/Resources/Data/Products/`

## üîó Module Integration

### Cross-Lesson Connections
- **Lesson 2.1 ‚Üí 2.2**: Interfaces designed in 2.1 are implemented in composition patterns in 2.2
- **Lesson 2.2 ‚Üí 2.3**: Component composition enables event-driven communication patterns
- **Lesson 2.3 ‚Üí 2.4**: Events can be triggered by ScriptableObject state changes
- **All Lessons ‚Üí Module 3**: These patterns provide foundation for larger system architecture

### Real Project Evolution
Our customer system demonstrates the progression:
1. **Monolithic Design**: Single Customer class handling everything
2. **Interface Introduction**: Separated concerns with focused interfaces
3. **Component Composition**: Broke monolith into specialized components
4. **Event Integration**: Added loose coupling through events
5. **Data-Driven Configuration**: Externalized behavior through ScriptableObjects

## üíª Practical Applications

### Code Pattern Examples

#### Interface Segregation
```csharp
// Instead of one large interface
public interface IBadCustomer
{
    void Move(Vector3 destination);
    void SelectProduct(Product product);
    void UpdateVisuals();
    void ProcessPayment();
    void HandleAudio();
    // ... 20+ methods
}

// Use focused interfaces
public interface ICustomerMovement
{
    bool MoveToPosition(Vector3 position);
    bool HasReachedDestination();
}

public interface ICustomerBehavior
{
    void StartShopping();
    void SelectProduct(Product product);
}
```

#### Component Composition
```csharp
public class Customer : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Composed of specialized components
    public CustomerMovement Movement { get; private set; }
    public CustomerBehavior Behavior { get; private set; }
    public CustomerVisuals Visuals { get; private set; }
    
    private void Awake()
    {
        // Initialize composition
        Movement = GetComponent<CustomerMovement>();
        Behavior = GetComponent<CustomerBehavior>();
        Visuals = GetComponent<CustomerVisuals>();
    }
}
```

#### Event-Driven Communication
```csharp
public class ProductInteraction : MonoBehaviour
{
    public System.Action<Product> OnProductPurchased;
    
    public void PurchaseProduct()
    {
        // Notify all interested systems
        OnProductPurchased?.Invoke(product);
    }
}
```
