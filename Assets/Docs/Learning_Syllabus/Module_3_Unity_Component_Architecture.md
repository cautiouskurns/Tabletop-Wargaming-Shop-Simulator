## üìö Lesson Breakdown

### Lesson 3.1: Single Responsibility Components üéØ
**Difficulty**: üü¢ **Duration**: 45 minutes

#### Core Concepts
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: One reason to change per component
- **Component Granularity**: Finding the right balance between too few and too many components
- **Unity Lifecycle Integration**: How SRP applies to MonoBehaviour lifecycle methods

#### Project Context
Our evolution from monolithic Customer class to specialized CustomerBehavior, CustomerMovement, CustomerVisuals, and CustomerEconomics components.

#### Key Learning Outcomes
- Identify when a component has too many responsibilities
- Refactor complex components into focused, single-purpose components
- Design component APIs that are easy to understand and maintain

#### Files Referenced
- `Assets/Scripts/2 - Entities/Products/Core/Product.cs` - Core product functionality
- `Assets/Scripts/2 - Entities/Products/Visuals/ProductVisuals.cs` - Visual-only concerns
- `Assets/Scripts/2 - Entities/Products/Economics/ProductEconomics.cs` - Economic calculations
- `Assets/Scripts/2 - Entities/Products/Interaction/ProductInteraction.cs` - Player interaction

#### Real-World Example
```csharp
// Before: Monolithic Product class (400+ lines)
public class MonolithicProduct : MonoBehaviour
{
    // State management, visuals, economics, interaction, audio, effects...
    // Everything in one class!
}

// After: Focused, single-responsibility components
public class Product : MonoBehaviour          // Core state only
public class ProductVisuals : MonoBehaviour   // Visual representation only
public class ProductEconomics : MonoBehaviour // Pricing and economics only
public class ProductInteraction : MonoBehaviour // Player interaction only
```

### Lesson 3.2: Cross-Component Communication üåê
**Difficulty**: üü° **Duration**: 60 minutes

#### Core Concepts
- **Communication Patterns**: Direct references, events, shared interfaces, message passing
- **Coupling vs Cohesion**: Balancing component independence with effective coordination
- **Unity-Specific Patterns**: GetComponent, RequireComponent, component caching

#### Project Context
How Customer components coordinate shopping behavior, movement, and visual updates without creating dependency chains.

#### Key Learning Outcomes
- Choose appropriate communication patterns for different scenarios
- Implement loose coupling between components while maintaining system cohesion
- Handle component dependencies and initialization order reliably

#### Files Referenced
- `Assets/Scripts/3 - Systems/AI/Customer/Core/Customer.cs` - Component coordination hub
- `Assets/Scripts/3 - Systems/AI/Customer/Core/CustomerBehavior.cs` - Behavior state management
- `Assets/Scripts/3 - Systems/AI/Customer/Movement/CustomerMovement.cs` - Movement coordination

#### Communication Pattern Examples
```csharp
// Pattern 1: Direct Component References (tightly coupled, fast)
public class Customer : MonoBehaviour
{
    public CustomerMovement Movement { get; private set; }
    public CustomerBehavior Behavior { get; private set; }
}

// Pattern 2: Event-Driven (loosely coupled, flexible)
public class CustomerBehavior : MonoBehaviour
{
    public System.Action<CustomerState> OnStateChanged;
}

// Pattern 3: Interface-Based (testable, mockable)
public class Customer : MonoBehaviour, ICustomer
{
    private ICustomerMovement movement;
    private ICustomerBehavior behavior;
}
```

### Lesson 3.3: Manager Pattern Implementation üèóÔ∏è
**Difficulty**: üî¥ **Duration**: 75 minutes

#### Core Concepts
- **Manager Responsibilities**: Coordination, lifecycle management, resource allocation
- **Singleton vs Static vs Instance**: When to use each approach for managers
- **Service Locator Pattern**: Providing global access without tight coupling

#### Project Context
GameManager coordinates shop operations, customer lifecycle, and economic systems. ShopUI manages all user interface interactions.

#### Key Learning Outcomes
- Design manager classes that coordinate without micromanaging
- Implement service location patterns for system access
- Handle complex system initialization and shutdown sequences

#### Files Referenced
- `Assets/Scripts/1 - Core/Managers/GameManager.cs` - Central game coordination
- `Assets/Scripts/4 - UI/ShopUI/ShopUI.cs` - UI system management
- `Assets/Scripts/3 - Systems/Inventory/InventoryManager.cs` - Inventory system coordination

#### Manager Pattern Examples
```csharp
// Coordination Manager (doesn't do work, coordinates others)
public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static GameManager Instance { get; private set; }
    
    [Header("System References")]
    private InventoryManager inventoryManager;
    private CustomerSpawner customerSpawner;
    private ShopUI shopUI;
    
    public void ProcessCustomerPurchase(float amount, float satisfaction)
    {
        // Coordinate between systems without doing the work
        inventoryManager.UpdateSales(amount);
        shopUI.UpdateDisplays();
        // Manager coordinates, components do the actual work
    }
}

// Service Manager (provides centralized access to services)
public class ServiceLocator : MonoBehaviour
{
    private static readonly Dictionary<Type, object> services = new Dictionary<Type, object>();
    
    public static T GetService<T>() where T : class
    {
        return services.TryGetValue(typeof(T), out object service) ? service as T : null;
    }
}
```

// Unit Test: Testing component in isolation
[Test]
public void CustomerMovement_WhenDestinationSet_ShouldStartMoving()
{
    // Arrange
    var customer = CreateTestCustomer();
    var movement = customer.GetComponent<CustomerMovement>();
    
    // Act
    bool result = movement.MoveToPosition(Vector3.forward);
    
    // Assert
    Assert.IsTrue(result);
    Assert.IsFalse(movement.HasReachedDestination());
}

// Integration Test: Testing system interaction
[UnityTest]
public IEnumerator CustomerSystem_WhenShoppingCompletes_ShouldMoveToCheckout()
{
    // Arrange: Set up complete customer system
    var customer = CreateFullCustomerWithBehaviorTree();
    
    // Act: Simulate shopping completion
    customer.selectedProducts.Add(CreateTestProduct());
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(customer.ShoppingTime + 1f);
    
    // Assert: Verify system state
    Assert.AreEqual(CustomerState.ReadyForCheckout, customer.currentState);
}
```

## üîó Module Integration

### System Architecture Progression
This module demonstrates scaling from components to complete systems:

1. **Lesson 3.1**: Individual components with clear responsibilities
2. **Lesson 3.2**: Components working together effectively
3. **Lesson 3.3**: Managers coordinating multiple component systems
4. **Lesson 3.4**: Testing validates the entire architecture

### Real Project Architecture
Our project demonstrates this progression:
- **Products**: 4 focused components (Core, Visuals, Economics, Interaction)
- **Customers**: 4 coordinated components (Core, Behavior, Movement, Visuals)
- **Shop Systems**: Multiple managers (Game, Inventory, UI) coordinating subsystems
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite validating component interactions
