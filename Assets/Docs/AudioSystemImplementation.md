# Audio Feedback System Implementation

## Overview

The comprehensive audio feedback system provides immersive audio experiences for the tabletop wargaming shop simulator, including centralized audio management, performance optimization, and user control over audio settings.

## System Architecture

### AudioManager (Singleton)
- **Location**: `/Assets/Scripts/Audio/AudioManager.cs`
- **Purpose**: Centralized audio control with global access
- **Features**:
  - Singleton pattern for global access from any system
  - Audio pooling for overlapping SFX performance
  - Category-based volume control (Master, SFX, UI, Ambient)
  - Event-driven audio triggers for game actions
  - Settings persistence via PlayerPrefs

### SettingsUI
- **Location**: `/Assets/Scripts/UI/SettingsUI.cs`
- **Purpose**: User interface for audio control
- **Features**:
  - Volume sliders for all audio categories (0-100% display)
  - Real-time volume adjustment with AudioManager integration
  - Settings panel toggle functionality
  - Proper event handler cleanup

### ShopUI Integration
- **Location**: `/Assets/Scripts/UI/ShopUI.cs`
- **Purpose**: Settings button integration with main UI
- **Features**:
  - Settings button event handling
  - Automatic SettingsUI reference caching
  - UI click audio feedback
  - Clean event handler management

## Audio Categories

### 1. Master Volume
- Controls overall audio output level
- Affects all other audio categories proportionally
- Range: 0.0 to 1.0 (0% to 100%)

### 2. SFX Volume
- Controls sound effects (purchase sounds, interactions)
- Uses audio pooling for overlapping sounds
- Pool size: 10 audio sources by default

### 3. UI Volume
- Controls interface sounds (button clicks, menu transitions)
- Uses dedicated single audio source
- No pooling needed (UI sounds rarely overlap)

### 4. Ambient Volume
- Controls background atmosphere audio
- Loops continuously during gameplay
- Default: 60% volume for subtle atmosphere

## Audio Assets

### Required Audio Files
- **Location**: `/Assets/Audio/`
- **SFX Folder**:
  - `PurchaseSuccess.wav` - Customer purchase completion
  - `UIClick.wav` - Button and UI interaction sounds
- **Ambient**:
  - `ShopAtmosphere.wav` - Background shop ambience

### Audio Setup Requirements
1. Import audio files to appropriate folders
2. Configure audio import settings for optimal performance
3. Assign audio clips to AudioManager inspector fields
4. Set up AudioManager prefab for easy scene integration

## Performance Optimization

### Audio Pooling System
- **Pool Size**: 10 SFX audio sources (configurable)
- **Benefits**: 
  - Prevents GameObject creation/destruction overhead
  - Allows multiple simultaneous sound effects
  - Reduces garbage collection pressure
- **Implementation**: Queue-based available source management

### Memory Management
- Audio sources reused from pool
- Coroutine-based pool return system
- Automatic cleanup on object destruction
- Efficient clip caching and reuse

## Event Integration

### Automatic Audio Triggers
- Purchase success events (when customers buy products)
- UI interaction feedback (button clicks, menu navigation)
- Ambient atmosphere management (start/stop based on game state)

### Manual Audio Calls
```csharp
// Play purchase success sound
AudioManager.Instance.PlayPurchaseSuccess();

// Play UI click with pitch variation
AudioManager.Instance.PlayUIClick(1.1f);

// Play custom SFX
AudioManager.Instance.PlaySfx(customClip, pitch: 0.9f, volume: 0.8f);

// Control ambient audio
AudioManager.Instance.StartAmbientAudio();
AudioManager.Instance.StopAmbientAudio();
```

## Settings Persistence

### PlayerPrefs Keys
- `AudioManager_MasterVolume` - Master volume setting
- `AudioManager_SfxVolume` - SFX volume setting  
- `AudioManager_UiVolume` - UI volume setting
- `AudioManager_AmbientVolume` - Ambient volume setting

### Automatic Saving
- Settings automatically saved when changed via UI
- Loaded on AudioManager initialization
- Persistent between game sessions

## Unity Setup Instructions

### 1. AudioManager Prefab Creation
1. Create empty GameObject named "AudioManager"
2. Add AudioManager component
3. Assign audio clips in inspector:
   - Purchase Success Clip: `PurchaseSuccess.wav`
   - UI Click Clip: `UIClick.wav`
   - Shop Atmosphere Clip: `ShopAtmosphere.wav`
4. Save as prefab in `/Assets/Prefabs/Audio/AudioManager.prefab`
5. Place in each scene or use DontDestroyOnLoad

### 2. Settings UI Setup
1. Create settings panel in UI Canvas
2. Add SettingsUI component to panel
3. Setup volume sliders (Master, SFX, UI, Ambient)
4. Configure slider ranges (0 to 1) and wholeNumbers (false)
5. Add TextMeshProUGUI components for volume percentage display
6. Assign close button for settings panel

### 3. Main UI Integration
1. Add settings button to main UI
2. Assign settings button reference in ShopUI component
3. SettingsUI will be automatically found and cached
4. Settings panel shows/hides via button click

## Testing Checklist

### Audio Playback
- [ ] Purchase success sound plays on customer transactions
- [ ] UI click sounds play on button interactions
- [ ] Ambient atmosphere loops continuously
- [ ] Multiple SFX can play simultaneously without cutting off

### Volume Controls
- [ ] Master volume affects all audio categories
- [ ] Individual category volumes work independently
- [ ] Volume changes apply immediately
- [ ] Volume percentages display correctly (0-100%)

### Settings Persistence
- [ ] Volume settings save when adjusted
- [ ] Settings persist between game sessions
- [ ] Default values load correctly on first run

### Performance
- [ ] No audio stuttering or performance drops
- [ ] Audio pool handles multiple simultaneous sounds
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during gameplay

## Debugging Tools

### AudioManager Debug Methods
```csharp
// Print current audio pool status
Debug.Log(AudioManager.Instance.GetPoolStatus());

// Check if any audio is playing
bool isPlaying = AudioManager.Instance.IsAnyAudioPlaying();

// Editor context menu testing (in Unity Editor)
// Right-click AudioManager component:
// - Test Purchase Sound
// - Test UI Click Sound  
// - Print Pool Status
```

### Console Logging
- AudioManager logs initialization status
- Volume changes logged for debugging
- Pool exhaustion warnings if too many simultaneous sounds
- Component reference warnings if UI elements missing

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Audio Fading**: Smooth volume transitions for ambient audio
2. **3D Spatial Audio**: Positional audio for immersive shop experience
3. **Dynamic Music**: Adaptive background music based on shop activity
4. **Audio Accessibility**: Visual audio indicators for hearing-impaired players
5. **Audio Presets**: Predefined volume configurations for different player preferences

### Integration Points
- Customer satisfaction audio cues
- Product-specific audio feedback
- Time-of-day ambient variations
- Shop expansion audio events
