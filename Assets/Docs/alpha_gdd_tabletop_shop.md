### üí¨ Basic Dialogue System

- Supports:
  - Greeting ‚Üí lore question ‚Üí response
  - Simple conditional lines (e.g., ‚ÄúYou got that right!‚Äù if correct)
- Dialogue loaded from `DialogueTreeSO`.
- Future link: triggers rep gains or mood states.

### üñ•Ô∏è Inventory Ordering Portal
- In-game tablet or terminal opens a faux B2B supplier web UI.
