Conversation Summary with Diarmuid - Tabletop Shop Simulator Alpha

This conversation focused on preparing and implementing an Alpha build of Diarmuid's tabletop shop simulator game. Key discussion points included:

1. **Alpha Feature Focus**:
   - Prioritizing lore interaction, a codex system, basic dialogue, and a supplier inventory ordering system.
   - Deprioritizing events and in-game sessions for the Alpha.

2. **Alpha GDD and Implementation Plan**:
   - A comprehensive 4-week implementation plan was provided, broken down into foundation, content, integration, and polish.
   - Systems included: LoreKnowledgeBaseSO, DialogueTreeSO, SupplierInventorySO, ReputationSystem, Customer AI, UI, and shelf stocking.

3. **Prompt Engineering for AI Copilot**:
   - Prompt for creating `LoreKnowledgeBaseSO` ScriptableObject with sample entries.
   - Prompt for creating `DialogueTreeSO` with support for conditional responses and branching logic.

Each prompt was tailored to be used in AI copilots or code generators (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT Code Interpreter) with clear instructions and expected fields.

The plan and prompts aim to keep the Alpha focused, testable, and scalable for future development.
